# svelte-audio-waveform

Creates audio waveforms from array of peaks.

This is a port of https://github.com/SoundstripeEngineering/react-audio-waveform from React to Svelte.

Kinda WIP, not following best practices or anything, use at your own discretion.

For details, usage, docs you can refer to the original React repo, for now.

My first project with Selte/Sapper, also I had almost no previous experience with React. But this proved to me how easy it is to get started with Svelte + this needs much less of a code than original version written in React. (Svelte's bind is really magic).
